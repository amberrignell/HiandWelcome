# HiandWelcome

This website is my application to the Founders and Coders programming bootcamp. I built it using the knowledge I gained from 
completing the prerequisites on freecodecamp. 

One section of the website is missing, but I got caught up with my dissertation and so ran out of time to include it. I'm
adding it here in the README as a quick fix. It describes my experience with coding so far and what I thought of the
prerequisites. 


FreeCodeCamp: 
I believe your prerequisites were very useful. If I do not get into Founders and Coders you will have still had an impact in 
making me complete these. I would have never had the motivation to do them all had I not needed them for the application. I am 
close to fully completing the full Responsive Web Design and Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures, and plan to finish them
as soon as possible. I found them to be very useful resources to go back to when developing my website. 

I have definitely preferred javascript to css and html. Codewars exercises have been fun, and a really great way of learning 
about new ways to do things. I always like reading the different answers to see how others have achieved them using fewer lines
of code. One thing I did struggle with a bit more when I got into the higher KYU katas was how to avoid timeout errors. 
It seems to me like it is a very important concept to understand and I look forward to learning about it in the course 
(or after hours if this is not in the curriculum). 

Codebar: 
Going to Codebar events has been really helpful in learning how to think like a programmer. After having been to a couple of 
these, I signed up to become a volunteer organiser and am currently helping run their online events on Discord. 

FAC meetups: 
I attended the FAC short course in February, and enjoyed getting an insight into pair programming. Having to talk someone else 
through each line of code was a great way of testing whether I properly understood all the concepts. 
I also joined a couple of the online meetups this month. 

Hackathon: 
Upon Georgiaâ€™s recommendation (who I met at CodeFirst: Girls before she joined FAC), I went to my first hackathon this January.
At HackThePress I joined a team of two programmers, one UX/UI designer and someone from the news sector to come up with a news 
aggregator which would visually represent what topics people had read about and how in-depth their knowledge of these were 
through a knowledge map. We are currently working on taking this project forward, which is a great learning opportunity for me!

Website: 
I'm quite pleased with the final outcome of my website, although I do believe it can still be greatly improved. 
The process was a great learning opportunity though, and the more I tried to fix stuff which was going wrong, the quicker I was 
at fixing issues. I think the most valuable skills I've learnt is understanding where to look when something has gone wrong. 
For css for example, I use inspect to see what css styles have been applied to the section that's being problematic, and then
tick or untick specific styles to observe what they are actually doing. With javascript, I love adding lines throughout my code
to be able to see on the console what is going on at each step of the way. 

If I had more time, I would add links within my text towards what I refer to (for example the Mudamos app which you can read
about here: https://itsrio.org/en/projetos/mudamos/). I had issues adding these because the encrypt/decrypt function altered
any anchor tags that were nested in the paragraphs. 

I would also make the website more responsive. Again, I struggled a bit with css so the website does not look great when put 
into phone format. 

I would also focus more on accessibility.
